In this activity, I did the following:
1. Gave the page a concise title.
2. Set up semantic elements in the html page for better organization.
3. Set up comments in the css page for better navigation around it.
4. Fixed the link for the first item in the navigation bar at the top of the page.
5. Set up alt attributes for all images (except the background image).
6. I felt like the heading attributes were already in a sequential order, but I did move the header div to be above the header 1 line.
